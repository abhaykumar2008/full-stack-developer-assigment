1.Explain the relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities from the above diagram.
Answer:-

Product: This entity represents a product sold on the e-commerce website. It has attributes such as:
id: A unique identifier for the product
name: The name of the product
desc: A description of the product
SKU: The product's stock keeping unit
category_id: A foreign key that references the id of the product category (explained below)
inventory_id: A foreign key that references the id of the product's inventory (not shown in the image)
price: The price of the product
discount_id: A foreign key that references the id of the discount applied to the product (not shown in the image)
created_at: The date and time the product record was created
modified_at: The date and time the product record was last modified
deleted_at: The date and time the product record was deleted (soft delete)
Product_Category: This entity represents a category that groups products. It has attributes such as:
id: A unique identifier for the product category
name: The name of the product category
desc: A description of the product category
created_at: The date and time the product category record was created
modified_at: The date and time the product category record was last modified
deleted_at: The date and time the product category record was deleted (soft delete)
The relationship between these two entities is one-to-many. A product can belong to one category (represented by the category_id foreign key in the Product entity), but a category can have many products.  This is reflected by the crow's foot notation at the "many" side of the relationship.
For example, a bicycle product would have a category_id that references the "Bicycles" category, but the "Bicycles" category could have many different bicycle products.

2.How could you ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it?
Answer:-
Sure, based on the image you sent, there are a couple of ways to ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it:

1. Use a foreign key constraint: The `product_category` table has an `id` field that is likely set as a primary key. The `Product` table has a `category_id` field that is a foreign key referencing the `id` field in the `product_category` table.  A foreign key constraint can be added to the `Product` table to ensure that the value in the `category_id` field  always references a valid record in the `product_category` table. This would prevent products from being added to the `Product` table with invalid category IDs.

2. Validation on insert: When a new product is added to the database, you can write code to validate that the `category_id` being assigned to the product exists in the `product_category` table. This validation could be done within the application logic  before the data is inserted into the database, or it could be done using a database trigger.

3. Use a check constraint: A check constraint can be added to the `Product` table to ensure that the value in the `category_id` field is always  within a valid range of values.  This range of values would be defined by the existing IDs in the `product_category` table. While this would prevent invalid IDs from being entered, it wouldn't prevent accidentally assigning a deleted or inactive category to a product.
